# Teledyne SO2 calibration

Unit has been running for many days in PETB 417 sampling either rooftop or
laboratory air. Was used in HCHO deployment before that, but not for IAQ.
Prepping unit for deployment at Urbabnova WSU Spokane campus AQ reference site.

Will use data files saved to analyzer so all timestamps reflect it's clock.
Analyzer already setup for analog output range of 0-100 ppb (HCHO, IAQ).

Calibrated using Teledyne 700U (sn 294) with Teledyne T701H (sn 195) as zero
air source and SO2 gas standard (cyl# JB04157, 15.49 ppmv SO2 +/-0.17 ppmv NIST)

### Notes

19:57   Begin flowing SO2 free air
20:43   Change stream composition to 100 ppbv SO2
21:26   ...idiot.. failed to verify all valves were open... verified actually
        delivering 100 ppb now
21:28   Still waiting to observe response from analyzer
21:20   Increased stream flow from 1.55->1.8 LPLM; overflow now aggressive
21:41   Steadily climbing now.. currently 39 ppb
22:09   OK, has reached only 86 ppb so far...
22:42   So close... climbing up past 99.78 ppb now
23:13   Appears to have stabilized around 103 ppb
23:14   Changed delivery conc to 18 ppb
23:20   Holy crap.. already reporting 18.81 ppb... perhaps it was just line
        conditioning?!
23:53   Halted delivery gas stream and detached from inlet
